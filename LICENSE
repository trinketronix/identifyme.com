### **Apache 2.0**
- Like MIT but includes explicit patent rights
- Slightly more complex
- Use if: You want to protect against patent lawsuits

### **GPL 3.0**
- Restrictive: Anyone using your code must open-source their work too
- Use if: You want to ensure all derived works stay open source

### **Unlicense**
- Ultra-permissive: Public domain
- Use if: You want zero restrictions, not even attribution required

**Recommendation**: **MIT License** is perfect for your use case. It says "Use this freely, just mention where it came from."
